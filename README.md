Above is the current build version of the YogNatomy landing page. On the lefthand side of the screen I built a navigation sidebar using a repurposed bootstrap component. This sidebar features hover detection, and collapsible submenus for a variety of pages. At the bottom of the sidebar you can see the "Register" button and the "Log In" button. These controls are fixed, meaning that no matter how long the page is they will always be at the same relative position in the sidebar.
